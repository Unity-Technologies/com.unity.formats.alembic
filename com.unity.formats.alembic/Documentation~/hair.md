# Working with Hair

Something about using Grooms. Good resource for more words https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.demoteam.hair 
Generated from Alembic files with curves

when importing an alembic file, Unity can be used with the [Hair package](link) to generate a [groom](link) based on an Alembic files containing curves.

To enable this workflow, you must have the Hair package installed and your alembic must contain curves or curve data. 
Make sure that the Import Curves setting is enabled.

To create an Alembic Shot:

1. Drag a GameObject with an [Alembic Stream Player](ref_StreamPlayer.md) component onto the Clips view in Timeline.

2. Select **Add Clip With Alembic Track** from the pop-up menu.

   A new Alembic clip appears in the Clips view.

3. Play back the animation using the [Timeline Play controls](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.timeline@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/tl-play-ctrls.html) in the Timeline window.

# Working with Particles

When you import an Alembic file that contains particles, the Alembic package automatically adds two custom components to help you work with particles:

* The [Alembic Point Cloud component](ref_PointCloud.md) helps you define the shape and volume of the particle's point cloud. You can set the extents of the bounding box (AABB) and particle sorting options for the cloud.
* The [Alembic Point Renderer component](ref_PointRenderer.md) helps you customize the appearance of the points. You can define shadows, trails, shapes, and Materials for the points in the cloud.

# Export to Alembic with the Recorder

Use the [Recorder](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.recorder@latest) package in addition to the Alembic package to record the animation of a GameObject in Play mode and export it as an Alembic clip.

The Alembic Clip Recorder includes the overall functionality of the Unity Recorder in addition to its own [Recorder properties](ref_Recorder.md):

* You can use the Alembic Clip Recorder as any other recorder, either via the Recorder window or via a Recorder Clip in [Timeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.timeline@latest/index.html).
* You can use more than one recorder of any type at the same time to simultaneously capture different data.
* The ways to start and stop the recording of Alembic files are the same as for any other recorder type.

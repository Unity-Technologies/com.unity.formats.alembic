# Creating Alembic files in Autodesk® Digital Content Creation applications

Many Digital Content Creation applications allow you to export models as Alembic (ABC) files. You need to export your alembics with additionnal data to make them fully compatible with Unity.

| Face Sets  | On export, enable **Write Face Sets**  | In the  **Export Data**  section, enable  **Material IDs**  | This will allow you to access the Face Sets in Unity. When Unity imports an alembic mesh that contains facesets, it will create a sub-mesh for every face set. This allows you to apply a unique material for every faceset/sub-mesh (instead of one material for the whole object). You need facesets to use the [Alembic Material Remapper](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.formats.alembic@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/materials.html#automatic-re-mapping-based-on-face-set-names). |
| Color Sets | On export, enable **Write Color Sets** | In the  **Export Data**  section, enable  **Vertex Colors** | To access the color vertex values of an alembic in Unity, the values must be written to the file in the first place. Vertex Colors allow you to define a specific color for each vertex of a mesh. Then during rendering, this color will be used as the surface color of the object.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| UV Sets    | On export, enable **Write UV Sets**    | In the **Export Data**  section, enable  **UVs**            | To access the UVs of an alembic in Unity, the values must be written to the file in the first place. UVs are used to map textures onto polygon meshes. They define what portion of a texture should be applied to which polygon of a mesh. They could also be used to encode arbitrary data into them that can later be used for various cases.                                                                                                                           |

Please note that there is currently no way to export materials for alembic in a straighforward way.

- Fixed a bug where the exporter was writing the incorrect Camera rotation parameters.

## [2.0.0-preview.1] - 2019-12-20
### Changes
- Minimum Unity version is 2019.3.
- Introduced public API for Alembic playback and recording.
- Loading of Alembic files is now multi-threaded.

- HDF5 format is Obsolete.
- Fixed a bug where the face-id were being sorted in ascending order.
- Fixed a bug that caused crashes when importing point clouds that had no velocity information.
- Fixed a bug that caused exported geometries to have too many triangles.

## [1.0.6] - 2019-08-26
### Changes
- Added support for Linux
- Fixed incorrect normal calculation when the UVs were split
- Fixed lost references to the scene GameObject when renaming the alembic asset.
- Fixed the LitAlembic material compatibility with HDRP 4.10 (latest 2018.4 version). For 2019.2+ HDRP standard materials support vertex motion vectors.
-Fixed Vertex colour import from Houdini.

### Known Issues
- HDF5 is not supported under Linux for import or export.


## [1.0.5] - 2019-05-10
### Changes
- Fixed regression introduced in 1.0.4 where old Alembic scene instances would lose prefab connection. New scene instances made with 1.0.4 are unfortunately unrecoverable

## [1.0.4] - 2019-05-02
### Changes
- Fixed crash in the Exporter when using SwapFaces
- Fixed Branch recording mode in the Exporter
- Fixed Scene references being lost, when alembic prefab was being renamed

  imported at the same time

## [1.0.3] - 2019-04-09
### Changes
- Do not lock Alembic files when Windows
- Fix InheritXform on files from Blender
- Fix multibyte character names for Alembic nodes
- Fix crash from cyclic sampling

### Changes
- Removed BuildTarget.LinuxStandalone (obsolete) references for 2019.2+

## [1.0.1] - 2019-03-14
### Changes
- Removed UnityEngine.UI references

## [1.0.0] - 2019-01-15
### Changes
- Removed Timeline Alembic recorder
- General cleanup
### Known Issues
- The first time the Alembic package is used in a project, the shaders shipped with
it need to be reimported, or else all Alembic imports will fail (case 1125012)

## [1.0.0-preview.13] - 2019-01-15
### Changes
- Removed broken recording of particles
- Moved testing code into the package

## [1.0.0-preview.10] - 2019-01-15
### Changes
- AlembicShotClip registers the time of the AlembicStreamPlayer as driven so timeline changes to the scene are not persistent
- AlembicRecorderClip uses tags to target GameObject root when recording a subset of
  the scene. If there are multiple GameObjects that match this Tag, a warning appears
  in the inspector and recording is disabled.

## [1.0.0-preview.9] - 2019-01-03
### Changes
- Meshes generated by the AlembicStreamPlayer are not serialized with the Scene

## [1.0.0-preview.8] - 2018-12-19
### Changes
- Alembic files are No longer copied to the StreamingAssets folder
- renamed Linux dso to abci.so for consistency
- reordered DllImport path selection so Editor locations are always found first

### Known Issues
- If you rename the prefab once instantiated, all scene references are lost (move works)

### Changes
- Fixed Windows plugin platform settings
- Apply Transform On Points is now ON by default to be consistent with mesh behaviour
- Point clouds are no longer imported by default
- Bug fix: changes to time range were not persisted
- Updated label of assumeNonSkinnedMeshRendersAreConstant to "Static MeshRenderers" to prevent cropping at default width

### Known Issues
- Camera objects aren't using Physical Camera mode
- Points renderer motion vector shader doesn't work
- Camera nodes are still created as GameObjects even if we don't import cameras
- AlembicWaitForEndOfFrame script is visible from the Component list in the inspector

## [1.0.0-preview.6] - 2018-11-22

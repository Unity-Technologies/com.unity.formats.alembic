! CONTAINS SUBROUTINES
!   H5_SIZEOF
!
! NOTES
!   The Sun/Oracle compiler has the following restrictions on the SIZEOF intrinsic function:
!
!     "The SIZEOF intrinsic cannot be applied to arrays of an assumed size, characters of a 
!      length that is passed, or subroutine calls or names. SIZEOF returns default INTEGER*4 data. 
!      If compiling for a 64-bit environment, the compiler will issue a warning if the result overflows 
!      the INTEGER*4 data range. To use SIZEOF in a 64-bit environment with arrays larger 
!      than the INTEGER*4 limit (2 Gbytes), the SIZEOF function and 
!      the variables receiving the result must be declared INTEGER*8."
!
!    Thus, we can not overload the H5_SIZEOF function to handle arrays (as used in tH5P_F03.f90), or
!    characters that do not have a set length (as used in tH5P_F03.f90), sigh...

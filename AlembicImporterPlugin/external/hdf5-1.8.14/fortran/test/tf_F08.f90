! CONTAINS SUBROUTINES
!   H5_SIZEOF
!
! NOTES
!   This file contains "sizeof" functions that are F2008 standard compliant
!   and replace the non-standard 'SIZEOF' functions found in the file tf_F03.
!   Unfortunity we need to wrap the C_SIZEOF/STORAGE_SIZE functions to handle different
!   data types from the various tests.
!
!   F08+TS29113 requires C interoperable variable as argument for C_SIZEOF.
!   
!   This file will be build instead of tf_F03.f90 if the intrinsic fortran 
!   function C_SIZEOF/STORAGE_SIZE is found during configure.

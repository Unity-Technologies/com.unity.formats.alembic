# Alembic for Unity

Alembic for Unity is a Unity package developed and [distributed by Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.formats.alembic@latest), but also open to [user contribution](CONTRIBUTIONS.md).

Alembic is a data format mainly used in the VFX industry to store very large vertex cache data such as complex cloth and fluid simulation results, or complex animation rigs. For more information, see http://www.alembic.io/

The main features of the package include Alembic file import and export, which allows you to use Unity as a rendering or compositing tool, or perform various simulations in Unity and pass the results to other DCC tools.
